              Welcome to my site! I‚Äôm a software developer, graphic designer,
              cat lover, and a third-year Computer Science Specialist student at
              the University of Toronto. Ok, that last part is a little bit
              dull, but anyways, my main focus is in software development. For
              the past year, I had developed landing page websites for Easy
              Learning Academy, and a search engine for Special Olympics
              Ontario. Recently, I am working on a cross-platform mobile
              application ‚ÄúLinkus‚Äù, and a web project ‚ÄúUTOS‚Äù. Besides coding,
              arts and design is a huge part of me and I have designed posters,
              logos, and UI/UX layouts using Adobe Softwares. As my experience
              of graphic design and software development enhances, I see how
              these two correlate with each other. One plus one is more than
              two, design and developing projects always give me the happiness
              of three.
